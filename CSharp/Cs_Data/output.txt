 Demonstrate C# types

---------------
  int - value type
---------------
--- int t1 = 42 ---
Int32, t1
value: 42, size: 4
fields:
  m_value = 42
methods:
  CompareTo
  CompareTo
  Equals
  Equals
  GetHashCode
  ToString
  ToString
  ToString
  ToString
  TryFormat
  GetTypeCode
  GetType

--- int t1a = t1 ---
t1a is not same object as t1

---------------
  string - reference type
---------------
--- string t2 = "a string" ---
String, t2
value: a string, size: 8
--- Note: ---
  string has many methods - uncomment next line to see them
--- string t3 = t2 ---
String, t3
value: a string, size: 8
t3 is same object as t2
--- t3 += " is here" ---
String, t3
value: a string is here, size: 8
t3 is not same object as t2

---------------
  Object - base reference type
---------------
--- Object obj1 - new Object() ---
Object, obj
value: System.Object, size: 8
fields:
methods:
  GetType
  ToString
  Equals
  GetHashCode
--- Object obj2 = obj1 ---
obj2 is same object as obj1

---------------
  Svt Struct value type
---------------
--- Svt t4 = new Svt() ---
t4  { I:3, D:3.1415927, C:z }
Svt, t4
value: HelloData.Svt, size: 24
--- Note: ---
  value type: size of object in stackframe
fields:
  <I>k__BackingField = 3
  <D>k__BackingField = 3.1415927
  <C>k__BackingField = z
methods:
  get_I
  set_I
  get_D
  set_D
  get_C
  set_C
  printSelf
  Equals
  GetHashCode
  ToString
  GetType
--- Svt t4a = t4 ---
t4a  { I:3, D:3.1415927, C:z }
t4  { I:3, D:3.1415927, C:z }
t4a is not same object as t4
Svt, t4a
value: HelloData.Svt, size: 24
--- t4a.C = 'q' ---
t4a  { I:3, D:3.1415927, C:q }
t4  { I:3, D:3.1415927, C:z }
t4 is not same object as t4a

---------------
  Crt - ref type with ref member
---------------
--- Crt t5 = new Crt() ---
t5  { I:0, D:1, S:SomeString }
Crt, t5
value: HelloData.Crt, size: 8
--- Note: ---
  ref type: size of handle to object in heap
--- Crt t5a = t5 ---
t5a  { I:0, D:1, S:SomeString }
t5a is same object as t5
t5a.S is same object as t5.S
--- t5a.S = "new string" ---
t5a  { I:0, D:1, S:new string }
t5  { I:0, D:1, S:new string }
t5a is same object as t5
t5a.S is same object as t5.S
--- Note: ---
  source t5 was altered!

That's all Folks!
